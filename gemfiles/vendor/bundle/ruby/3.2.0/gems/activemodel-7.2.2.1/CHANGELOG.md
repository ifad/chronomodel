## Rails 7.2.2 (October 30, 2024) ##

*   Fix regression in `alias_attribute` to work with user defined methods.

    `alias_attribute` would wrongly assume the attribute accessor was generated by Active Model.

    ```ruby
    class Person
      include ActiveModel::AttributeMethods

      define_attribute_methods :name
      attr_accessor :name

      alias_attribute :full_name, :name
    end

    person.full_name # => NoMethodError: undefined method `attribute' for an instance of Person
    ```

*   Fix a bug where type casting of string to `Time` and `DateTime` doesn't
    calculate minus minute value in TZ offset correctly.

*   Port the `type_for_attribute` method to Active Model. Classes that include
    `ActiveModel::Attributes` will now provide this method. This method behaves
    the same for Active Model as it does for Active Record.

      ```ruby
      class MyModel
        include ActiveModel::Attributes

        attribute :my_attribute, :integer
      end

      MyModel.type_for_attribute(:my_attribute) # => #<ActiveModel::Type::Integer ...>
      ```
