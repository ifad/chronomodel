ChronoModel implements what Oracle sells as "Flashback Queries", with standard
SQL on free PostgreSQL. Academically speaking, ChronoModel implements a
[Type-2 Slowly-Changing Dimension][wp-scd-2] with [history tables][wp-scd-4].

All history keeping happens inside the database system, freeing application
code from having to deal with it. ChronoModel implements all the required
features in Ruby on Rails' ORM to leverage the database temporal structure
beneath.


## Design

The application model is backed by an updatable view in the default `public`
schema that behaves like a plain table to any database client.  When data in
manipulated on it, INSTEAD OF [triggers][pg-triggers] redirect the manipulations
to concrete tables.

*Current* data is held in a table in the `temporal` [schema][pg-schema], while
*History* is held in a table in the `history` schema that [inherits][pg-table-inheritance]
from the *Current* one, to get automated schema updates for free and other
benefits.

The current time is taken using [`current_timestamp`][pg-current-timestamp], so
that multiple data manipulations in the same transaction on the same records
always create a single history entry (they are _squashed_ together).

[Partitioning][pg-partitioning] of history is also possible: this design [fits the
requirements][pg-partitioning-excl-constraints] but it's not implemented yet.

See [README.sql][cm-readme-sql] for a SQL example defining the machinery for a
simple table.


## Active Record integration

All Active Record schema migration statements are decorated with code that
handles the temporal structure by e.g. keeping the triggers in sync or
dropping/recreating it when required by your migrations.

Data extraction at a single point in time and even `JOIN`s between temporal and
non-temporal data is implemented using sub-selects and a `WHERE` generated by
the provided `TimeMachine` module to be included in your models.

The `WHERE` is optimized using [GiST indexes][pg-gist-indexes] on the
`tsrange` defining record validity. Overlapping history is prevented
through [exclusion constraints][pg-exclusion-constraints] and the
[btree_gist][pg-btree-gist] extension.

All timestamps are _forcibly_ stored in as UTC, bypassing the
`default_timezone` setting.


## Requirements

* Ruby >= 2.2 (1.9 to 2.1 could still work, but aren't supported).
* Active Record 4.2 or 5.0 (4.2 doesn't work with Ruby 2.4, though)
* PostgreSQL >= 9.3
* The `btree_gist` PostgreSQL extension
* The `plpython` PostgreSQL extension if you have *JSON* (*not* JSONB) columns

With Homebrew:

    brew install --with-python postgres

With Apt:

    apt-get install postgresql-plpython

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'chrono_model'

And then execute:

    $ bundle


## Configuration

Configure your `config/database.yml` to use the `chronomodel` adapter:

```yaml
development:
  adapter: chronomodel
  username: ...
```

## Schema creation

ChronoModel hooks all `ActiveRecord::Migration` methods to make them temporal
aware.

```ruby
create_table :countries, temporal: true do |t|
  t.string     :common_name
  t.references :currency
  # ...
end
```

This creates the _temporal_ table, its inherited _history_ one the _public_
view and all the trigger machinery. Every other housekeeping of the temporal
structure is handled behind the scenes by the other schema statements. E.g.:

 * `rename_table`  - renames tables, views, sequences, indexes and triggers
 * `drop_table`    - drops the temporal table and all dependant objects
 * `add_column`    - adds the column to the current table and updates triggers
 * `rename_column` - renames the current table column and updates the triggers
 * `remove_column` - removes the current table column and updates the triggers
 * `add_index`     - creates the index in both _temporal_ and _history_ tables
 * `remove_index`  - removes the index from both tables


## Adding Temporal extensions to an existing table

Use `change_table`:

```ruby
change_table :your_table, temporal: true
```

If you want to also set up the history from your current data:

```ruby
change_table :your_table, temporal: true, copy_data: true
```

This will create an history record for each record in your table, setting its
validity from midnight, January 1st, 1 CE. You can set a specific validity with
the `:validity` option:

```ruby
change_table :your_table, :temporal => true, :copy_data => true, :validity => '1977-01-01'
```

Please note that `change_table` requires you to use *old_style* `up` and
`down` migrations. It cannot work with Rails 3-style `change` migrations.


## Selective Journaling

By default UPDATEs only to the `updated_at` field are not recorded in the
history.

You can also choose which fields are to be journaled, passing the following
options to `create_table`:

  * `:journal => %w( fld1 fld2 .. .. )` - record changes in the history only when changing specified fields
  * `:no_journal => %w( fld1 fld2 .. )` - do not record changes to the specified fields
  * `:full_journal => true`             - record changes to *all* fields, including `updated_at`.

These options are stored as JSON in the [COMMENT][pg-comment] area of the
public view, alongside with the ChronoModel version that created them.

This is visible in `psql` if you issue a `\d+`. Example after a test run:

    chronomodel=# \d+
                                                           List of relations
     Schema |     Name      |   Type   |    Owner    |    Size    |                           Description
    --------+---------------+----------+-------------+------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------
     public | bars          | view     | chronomodel | 0 bytes    | {"temporal":true,"chronomodel":"0.7.0.alpha"}
     public | foos          | view     | chronomodel | 0 bytes    | {"temporal":true,"chronomodel":"0.7.0.alpha"}
     public | plains        | table    | chronomodel | 0 bytes    |
     public | test_table    | view     | chronomodel | 0 bytes    | {"temporal":true,"journal":["foo"],"chronomodel":"0.7.0.alpha"}


## Data querying

Include the `ChronoModel::TimeMachine` module in your model.

```ruby
module Country < ActiveRecord::Base
  include ChronoModel::TimeMachine

  has_many :compositions
end
```

This will create a `Country::History` model inherited from `Country`, and add
an `as_of` class method.

```ruby
Country.as_of(1.year.ago)
```

Will execute:

```sql
SELECT "countries".* FROM (
  SELECT "history"."countries".* FROM "history"."countries"
  WHERE '#{1.year.ago}' <@ "history"."countries"."validity"
) AS "countries"
```

The returned `ActiveRecord::Relation` will then hold and pass along the
timestamp given to the first `.as_of()` call to queries on associated entities.
E.g.:

```ruby
Country.as_of(1.year.ago).first.compositions
```

Will execute:

```sql
SELECT "countries".*, '#{1.year.ago}' AS as_of_time FROM (
  SELECT "history"."countries".* FROM "history"."countries"
  WHERE '#{1.year.ago}' <@ "history"."countries"."validity"
) AS "countries" LIMIT 1
```

and then, using the above fetched `as_of_time` timestamp, expand to:

```sql
SELECT * FROM  (
  SELECT "history"."compositions".* FROM "history"."compositions"
  WHERE '#{as_of_time}' <@ "history"."compositions"."validity"
) AS "compositions" WHERE country_id = X
```

`.joins` works as well:

```ruby
Country.as_of(1.month.ago).joins(:compositions)
```

Expands to:

```sql
SELECT "countries".* FROM (
  SELECT "history"."countries".* FROM "history"."countries"
  WHERE '#{1.month.ago}' <@ "history"."countries"."validity"
) AS "countries" INNER JOIN (
  SELECT "history"."compositions".* FROM "history"."compositions"
  WHERE '#{1.month.ago}' <@ "history"."compositions"."validity"
) AS "compositions" ON compositions.country_id = countries.id
```

More methods are provided, see the [TimeMachine][cm-timemachine] source for
more information.


## History manipulation

History objects can be changed and `.save`d just like any other record.


## Running tests

You need a running PostgreSQL >= 9.3 instance. Create `spec/config.yml` with the
connection authentication details (use `spec/config.yml.example` as template).

You need to connect as  a database superuser, because specs need to create the
`btree_gist` extension.

Run `rake`. SQL queries are logged to `spec/debug.log`. If you want to see them
in your output, use `rake VERBOSE=true`.


## Usage with JSON (*not* JSONB) columns

[JSON][pg-json-type] does not provide an [equality operator][pg-json-func].
As both unnecessary update suppression and selective journaling require
comparing the OLD and NEW rows fields, this fails by default.

ChronoModel provides a naive JSON equality operator using a naive
comparison of JSON objects [implemented in pl/python][pg-json-opclass].

To load the opclass you can use the `ChronoModel::Json.create`
convenience method. If you don't use JSON don't bother doing this.

If you are on Postgres 9.4, you are **strongly encouraged to use JSONB**,
as it has an equality operator built-in, it's faster and stricter, and
offers many more indexing abilities and better performance than JSON.

## Caveats

 * Rails 4 support requires disabling tsrange parsing support, as it
   [is broken][r4-tsrange-broken] and  [incomplete][r4-tsrange-incomplete]
   as of now, mainly due to a [design clash with ruby][pg-tsrange-and-ruby].

 * The triggers and temporal indexes cannot be saved in schema.rb. The AR
   schema dumper is quite basic, and it isn't (currently) extensible.
   As we're using many database-specific features, Chronomodel forces the
   usage of the `:sql` schema dumper, and included rake tasks override
   `db:schema:dump` and `db:schema:load` to do `db:structure:dump` and
   `db:structure:load`.
   Two helper tasks are also added, `db:data:dump` and `db:data:load`.

 * The choice of using subqueries instead of [Common Table Expressions]
   [pg-ctes] was dictated by the fact that CTEs [currently act as an
   optimization fence][pg-cte-optimization-fence].
   If it will be possible [to opt-out of the fence][pg-cte-opt-out-fence]
   in the future, they will be probably be used again as they were [in the
   past][cm-cte-impl], because the resulting queries were more readable,
   and do not inhibit using `.from()` on the `AR::Relation`.
