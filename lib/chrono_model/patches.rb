      # * The +records+ are the parent records where the association is defined
      # * The +associations+ are the association names involved in preloading
      # * The +given_preload_scope+ is the preloading scope, that is used only
      #   in the :through association and it holds the intermediate records
      #   _through_ which the final associated records are eventually fetched.
      #
      # As the +preload_scope+ is passed around to all the different
      # incarnations of the preloader strategies, we are using it to pass
      # around the +as_of_time+ of the original query invocation, so that
      # preloaded records are preloaded honoring the +as_of_time+.

      # The +preload_scope+ is not nil only for through associations, but the
      # preloader interfaces expect it to be always defined, for consistency.

      # association types that do not have a preload_scope. It quacks like a
      # Relation, and it contains only the methods that are used by the other
      # preloader methods. We use this +NULL_RELATION+ to which we have added
      # the `as_of_time!` holder method.
      #
      # For `:through` associations, the +given_preload_scope+ is already a
      # +Relation+, that already has the +as_of_time+ getters and setters,
      # so we use it directly.
